## Brief Intro
Hello everyone, I am Jerry. I am currently a *struggling* student majoring in Computer Engineering. Unfortunately, the extent of my coding abilities is `System.out.println("Hello, World!")` so it has been impossible for me to get an internship. I have been going on [link](https://leetcode.com/) and practicing for my next coding interview but it is rough. But as a very wise person once said,
> What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

## Aspirations for a career
My rankings for what I want to do in the future:
1. Software development
2. IT for hospitals or clinics
3. Opening a restaurant 
4. Game development 
My third choice seems fairly out of place, but I really enjoy cooking.

## What I have to do in school
To get to my career, I have to:
- [] Do well in my classes to understand coding
- [] Get an internship
- [] Graduate from college
- [] Get on that job grind
It feels good being 0% of the way there

## Outside of school
Some things I enjoy doing:<br>
- Driving around  
    - I love driving because it lets me take my mind off of things. I am also a ~~professional~~ ~~amateur~~ aspiring racer.  
    - Unfortunately, yhe best way to describe my current car is **A N E M I C**. I do have really   big plans for my next car once I have enough money for it  
- Playing video games  
    - I have played Maplestory for far too long; I think I am entering my 12th year playing  
    - I have played League of Legends for also way too long - 8 years  
    - I have tried a lot of other games but have not stuck with any of them for nearly as long  
    - I am trying to reduce the number of hours I spend gaming and instead funnel my time into other things  
- Music  
    - I have been trying to get back into playing the piano  
    - I want to start learning guitar  
- Youtube  
    - I have been wanting to start a Youtube channel for as long as I can remember, but the type of content I want to produce keeps on changing.  
    - So far, I have been writing scripts for stories
